### Description: 
#### <p>This homework assignment was difficult, but worth it. I moved the index.js file outside the assets folder along with the html files.> I also specified the html routes on the html pages. While creating a locally functional page was tempting, figuring out how the server.js page worked as well as polishing up on my save and delete functions really helped. This will be one of the most memorable projects I have ever worked on in that it has taught me to save something to a page without saving it as a local object. </p>
